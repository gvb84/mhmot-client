It's a simple client written in Python3.x. The only dependency is
python3-requests. It enables one to emulate the Met Het Mes Op Tafel Android
app and play games programmatically. I used it to pit some bots against
eachother, attain the weekly high-score and acquire a database with answers to
all the questions. I did not use it to play against human players as it's no
fun to ruin other people's fun game.

Use it for benevolent, learning and fun purposes only is my advice.
